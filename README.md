### **Why Are Spins and Coins Important in Coin Master?**

In Coin Master, spins and coins are the lifeblood of the game. Spins are used to spin the in-game slot machine, which gives you a variety of rewards such as coins, pets, attack items, and more. Coins, on the other hand, are used to upgrade your villages and purchase chests to collect cards.  

Without spins and coins, you can get stuck, making it hard to progress or build your village. That’s where finding ways to get free spins and coins becomes crucial.
